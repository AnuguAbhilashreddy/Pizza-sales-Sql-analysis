# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL

This project showcases end-to-end data analysis of a fictional pizza shop using raw transactional data and pure SQL — no BI tools.

## 📊 Project Overview and Problem Statement

**Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL**  
This project analyzes transactional sales data from a fictional pizza shop. The goal was to extract meaningful business insights using SQL, focusing on product performance, sales trends, and operational patterns.

The project simulates a real-world scenario where a data analyst is tasked with turning raw order-level data into actionable recommendations — entirely through SQL queries, without the use of dashboards or BI tools.

This analysis was done as part of a self-driven SQL portfolio project to strengthen core SQL skills and showcase problem-solving ability using structured data.

## 🗂️ Data Structure / Data Modeling and Tools

The data was structured across **four relational tables** simulating a typical point-of-sale database:

- **pizza_types**: Contains information about pizza names, types, and categories  
- **pizzas**: Contains pizza size and price (linked to pizza type)  
- **orders**: Contains order date and time  
- **order_details**: Contains quantity of each pizza per order

📌 A relational **ER diagram** was used to map the relationships and perform joins effectively.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **MySQL**: For all SQL-based queries and analysis  
- **PowerPoint & Canva**: For designing the final business presentation  
- *(Optional)* Power BI was considered for visual testing but **not used** in the final analysis

## ✅ What I Did

- Wrote over 20+ SQL queries using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `CTEs`, and time functions
- Analyzed revenue trends, top-performing pizzas, category breakdowns, time-based patterns, and size-based sales
- Delivered insights in a clear, presentation-ready format with summaries and KPIs

## 🔍 Sample Insights:
- Classic Deluxe Pizza is the most sold (2,432 units)
- Thai Chicken Pizza generated ₹1.09M revenue
- Peak order time: 12–1 PM; Best day: Wednesday

## 📥 Dataset:
*Simulated dataset for learning purposes; not real customer data.*
